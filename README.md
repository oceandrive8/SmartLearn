You can **just save this as `README.md`**, push it to your repo, and it will render perfectly on GitHub with sections, badges, and markdown formatting.  

If you want, I can now **make the full project folder with placeholders** (`index.html`, `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) so you have a complete working repo ready to submit.  

Do you want me to do that?
